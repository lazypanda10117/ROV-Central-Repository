The endurance test is to test if constant discrete change in motor speed will cause pwm to overheat.

The PS2 control code takes analog values fron the thumbsticks and convert to x and y values. 

According to those values, the ROV will move towards the combined vector direction with respective magitude with respect to the distance from the thumbstick center. 

It took me a whole week to finish it due to constant variability and unstability in the values given and also errors from the theoritical values, such as center is not at 123 but at 129.
